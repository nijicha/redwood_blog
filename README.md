# Blog

> An example blog that powered by RedwoodJS + TailwindCSS = ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Prerequisites

- Redwood requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (>=14.19.x <=16.x) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (>=1.15)
- **Recommended**, Install [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com) for well managed Node.js and Yarn perfectly

Start by installing dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

Setup development database:

```
yarn rw prisma migrate dev
yarn rw prisma db seed
```

Start development server:

```
yarn rw dev
```

Your browser should automatically open to http://localhost:8910 where you'll see the HomePage

## Troubleshooting

If `prisma` warning

**prisma@npm:x.x.x must be built because it never has been before or the last one failed**

Remove `prisma` cache by `rm -rf ~/.cache/prisma`
